This repo implements a PowerPoint Add-in, which is **outlined in red** in the following picture.
The purpose is to insert photos into slides opened on PC from a personal phone
- you don't have to pair PC and phone in advance
- The phone can be an IOS device or Android device


The Add-in page will display a QR code for the phone to scan
